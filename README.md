An interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize churn patterns and insights

This project was created as part of my learning journey toward becoming a Data Analyst.


*Objectives:-
  Build a basic predictive model
  Understand customer churn patterns
  Visualize insights using Tableau

*Dataset Overview:-
  Total records: 7,043

*Tools & Skills Used:-
  Python (Pandas, NumPy)
  Data Cleaning & Preparation
  Data Visualization
  Tableau Dashboard
  Basic Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)
  
  
*ML MODEL:-
I HAVE MADE A ML MODEL WHICH PREDICTS  CUSTOMER CHURN.
  1. I HAVE TO FIRST CLEAN THE DATA, REMOVE NULL ROWS AND UNNECCESORY COLUMNS LIKE CUSTOMER ID.
  2. DID THE TRAIN TEST SPLIT OF 80/20.
  3. MODEL USED:- LOGISTIC REGRESSION
  4. ACCURACY:- 78%
   

*TABLEAU:-
Tableau Dashboard(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sanghraj.aadhale/viz/Book1_17654856369880/Dashboard1)

  1. CHURN BY CONTRACT
   MONTH-TO-MONTH:- 42.71%
   ONE YEAR      :- 11.28%
   TWO YEAR      :- 2.85%
   FROM THIS WE CAN SEE THAT, MONTH-TO MONTH HAVE HIGHEST CHURN AND TWO YEARS HAVE THE LOWEST.

  2. CHURN BY TENURE:-
   NEW CUSTOMERS HAVE 62% RISK OF GETTING CHURNED
   OLD CUSTOMERS(6 YEARS) ONLY HAVE 2% RISK.

  3. CHURN BY PAYMENT METHOD:-
     ELECTRONIC CHECK :-45.29%
     MAILED CHECK :- 19.20%
     BANK TRANSFER:- 16.73%
     CREDIT CARD  :- 15.25%
    FROM THIS WE CAN SEE THAT, THE PEOPLE WHO DO ELECTRONIC CHECK CHURN'S THE MOST
    AND THE LOWEST ONE IS CREDIT CARD

  
  
 *Business Recommendations:--
    1. PROMOTE ANNUAL CONTRACTS.
    2. TO KEEP THE NEW CUSTOMER ENGAGE FOCUS ON FIRST 6 - MONTH CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
    3. ENCOURAGE CREDIT CARD OVER ELECTRONIC CHECK
